## How to get started with the project?
To get started, what you'll want to do is get a few tools:
1. Download & Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or whatever preferred editor you want to use)
2. Download & Install [Node v10.6.3 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Download & Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
4. Create a folder/directory whever you want to store your project and run: ```git clone https://github.com/drozdowo/vgbay-client.git```
5. Open powershell, git-bash, or cmd and navigate to the directory with the project and run ```npm install```
6. Once that's done, you can run ```npm run start``` and the project should start.
7. Navigate to [https://localhost:9000](https://localhost:9000) to see the project!

## What tools are we using?
We're using these tools for development:
- React/Redux for the front end (React is our UI Framework, Redux will be our state manager if we end up using it)
- Express as our back end (Will send JSON to our front end)
- SQLite as our Database (exact same as SQL, but serverless. Allows us to just use a database file)

## What should I be doing?
When we get the project up and running, please check the issues section above for cards. If you want to try one, please feel free to move one
over to the 'In Progress' column, edit it, and add your name to it to show that you're working on it. From here, please create a branch with
a distinctive name (so we don't get confused as to what branch you made) and an actual issue for that branch (Needed, as we will be following) the "code review" agile process, and "feature branch" model from the course.

## Any questions?
Ask your question in the FB group and I'll try to get it answered for you ASAP.
